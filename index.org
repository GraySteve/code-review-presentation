* How it all started
** TMV project description
   #+begin_quote
   TMV is an application meant to aid municipalities in requesting changes in the governamental data on entities and objects pertaining to the said municipality.
   #+end_quote
** TMV project description
   #+begin_example
   Once upon a time there was a guy named John and after a certain intervention John became Jane.

   In order to legalize her transition, Jane needs to go to municipality and change her name.
   The clerk at the municipality, uses TMV to create a request to change the name and sex in governamental records.
   #+end_example
** Why?
   Issues in the previous test automation suite:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Handling explicit waits.
   - Maintainability.
   - Readability.
   - Need for a challenge.
** The start
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - After SoC course came the idea =This can be done better=.
   - The idea was pitched during a planning meeting.
   - After some discussions PO gave it the green light.
  #+begin_notes
  After SoC course I (Ștefan) decide that the old automation suite needed a rework.
  Also I needed a challenge to improve my coding skills.
  #+end_notes
* How did we reach the desired results
** The refactoring
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Migrate old solution to the model presented by George Chirilă.
   - Adapt the model to the particularities of our project:
     - Waits,
     - Class initialize steps
     - etc.
** The review: "over-the-shoulder"

   #+begin_notes
   We worked with informal method, the  "Over-the-shoulder" review.
   #+end_notes
** The review process
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Describe the intent
   - Describe the changes
   - Review & adjust
   #+begin_notes
   1. Describe the intent
      I want to get ahold of name of the attached document from a report.
   2. Describe the changes
      To do so, I used a XPath selector to grab the table with attachments and iterate over all rows to get the value from column X.
   3. Review & adjust
      Review & apply suggested changes.

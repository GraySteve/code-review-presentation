* How it all started
** TMV project description
   #+begin_quote
   TMV is an application meant to aid municipalities in requesting changes in the governamental data on entities and objects pertaining to the said municipality.
   #+end_quote
** TMV project description
   #+begin_example
   Once upon a time there was a guy named John and after a certain intervention John became Jane.

   In order to legalize her transition, Jane needs to go to municipality and change her name.
   The clerk at the municipality, uses TMV to create a request to change the name and sex in governamental records.
   #+end_example
** Why?
   Issues in the previous test automation suite:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Handling explicit waits.
   - Maintainability.
   - Readability.
   - Need for a challenge.
** The start
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - After SoC course came the idea =This can be done better=.
   - The idea was pitched during a planning meeting.
   - After some discussions PO gave it the green light.
  #+begin_notes
  After SoC course I (Ștefan) decide that the old automation suite needed a rework.
  Also I needed a challenge to improve my coding skills.
  #+end_notes
* How did we reach the desired results
** The refactoring
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - All started by refactoring the old solution of automated tests by implementing George C. model(Show pictures of solution before and after).
   - Treating special cases from one model to another. Such as waits , class initialize steps and so on.

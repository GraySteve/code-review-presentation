* How it all started
** TMV project description
   #+begin_quote
   TMV is an application meant to aid municipalities in requesting changes in the governamental data on entities and objects pertaining to the said municipality.
   #+end_quote
** TMV project description
   #+begin_example
   Once upon a time there was a guy named John.
   After a certain intervention John became Jane.

   Now, Jane needs to go to municipality and change her info.
   At the municipality the clerk uses TMV issue a request to change:
   - Name from John to Jane
   - Sex from M to F.
   #+end_example
** Why?
   - Issues in the previous test automation suite:
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - Handling explicit waits.
     - Maintainability.
     - Readability.
     - Did not fulfill all the project needs.
** The start
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - The idea came after attending a =School of Centric= course.
   - The refactoring was pitched during a planning meeting.
   - After some discussions the Product Owner gave it green light.
  #+begin_notes
  After SoC course I (Ștefan) decide that the old automation suite needed a rework.
  Also I needed a challenge to improve my coding skills.
  #+end_notes
* How did we reach the desired results
** The refactoring
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Migrate old solution to the model presented =School of Centric= course.
   - Adapt the model to the particularities of our project:
     - Waits,
     - Class initialize steps
     - etc.
** The review: "over-the-shoulder"

   #+begin_notes
   We worked with informal method, the  "Over-the-shoulder" review.
   #+end_notes
** The review process
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Describe the intent
   - Describe the changes
   - Review & adjust
   #+begin_notes
   1. Describe the intent
      I want to get ahold of name of the attached document from a report.
   2. Describe the changes
      To do so, I used a XPath selector to grab the table with attachments and iterate over all rows to get the value from column X.
   3. Review & adjust
      Review & apply suggested changes.

** Best example
   |                       | Old value | New Value |
   |-----------------------+-----------+-----------|
   | Maintainability index |        32 |        69 |
   | Cyclomatic complexity |        27 |         1 |
   | Class coupling        |        17 |        10 |
   | Lines of code         |       159 |        18 |

* Lessons learned
** From QA perspective
** From DEV perspective
** Insightful
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Working that close to someone gives you an insight into how they think about the project.
   - That broadens your own perception.
** Gratifying
   - Number of hours spent with Ștefan: *a lot*.
   - Number of dirty jokes: *even more*.
   - The satisfaction of contributing to a /new and unknown/ project: *priceless*.
* Conclusions
  - It was nice and fun experience (until we had to give the presentation).
  - We recommend everyone to try this.
* Questions?
* Thank you!
